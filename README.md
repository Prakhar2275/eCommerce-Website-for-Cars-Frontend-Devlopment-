# Project Title

CarSelling Website Clone

This project is a clone of a used car selling platform, created as a static webpage to showcase my HTML and CSS skills.
From the beginning, my primary goal was to master the art of aligning components perfectly and crafting a pixel-perfect layout that delivers a clean and professional user experience.

I focused heavily on responsiveness, ensuring the site looks top-notch across all screen sizes. 
To enhance the user interaction, I added subtle animations and transitions that respond smoothly when the screen size changes â€” creating a flawless and visually appealing experience.

Since itâ€™s a static webpage, my main emphasis was on the high-quality application of HTML and CSS, 
highlighting my capabilities on the frontend side of web development. Iâ€™ve done my best to reflect strong foundational skills in modern, responsive design.
